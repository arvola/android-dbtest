# android-dbtest

A project to test the usage and performance of various database abstract libraries for Android. This includes
mainly ORMs, but also some other approaches.

The goal is to implement a pre-defined data model using all of the different libraries, filling them with
test data, and performing different operations on that data.

The current data set is as follows:

* Four schools
* Each school has six grades, 1 through 6
* Each grade has 20 students
* Each student has 3 subjects

This means that there are 480 students, each with three random subjects. It's not a huge dataset, but it
should be big enough to cover most apps.
